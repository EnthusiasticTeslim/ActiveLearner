            In data-driven modeling, there exist emphasis on big data which sometimes might not be readily available. Generally, researchers including me prefers to use transfer learning which leverages the existence of data from another domain to enhance modeling scenario with limited dataset. Instead of transfer learning, another methodolody called Active learning which attempt to achieve high accuracy using as few labeled instances as possible, thereby minimizing the cost of obtaining labeled data, could be used.

## Plan
Implement different AL Query strategies to possibly increase performance while using small data\resolve missing data issues on
- [x] [Protein adsorption](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.4c01401) on polymer brushes
- [] [Material informatics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c05264) for property predictions
- [] [Electrochemical separation](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/6609a5619138d23161d5830e) with large missing data.
